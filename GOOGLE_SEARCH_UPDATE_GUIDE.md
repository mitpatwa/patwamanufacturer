# Google Search Results Update Guide

## üîç Why Google Still Shows Old Title

Google is still displaying "Patwa Manufacturer - Quality Manufacturing Solutions" because:

1. **Crawling Delays**: Google needs time to recrawl and reprocess your site
2. **Cache Issues**: Google's cache may still contain the old information
3. **Title Generation**: Google sometimes generates its own titles based on page content
4. **Indexing Process**: Updates can take 2-4 weeks to appear in search results

## ‚úÖ What We've Fixed

### 1. Updated HTML Title Tag
```html
<title>Patwa Manufacturer - Custom Tassels, Fringes, Braids & Decorative Trimmings</title>
```

### 2. Updated Meta Tags
```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Patwa Manufacturer - Custom Tassels, Fringes, Braids & Decorative Trimmings">
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Patwa Manufacturer - Custom Tassels, Fringes, Braids & Decorative Trimmings">
```

### 3. Added Structured Data
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebSite",
  "name": "Patwa Manufacturer",
  "alternateName": "Patwa Manufacturer - Custom Tassels, Fringes, Braids & Decorative Trimmings",
  "url": "https://patwamanufacturer.lovable.app/"
}
```

### 4. Updated Page Component
- Consistent title across all components
- Proper meta tag implementation
- Structured data reinforcement

## üöÄ How to Speed Up Google's Update

### 1. Google Search Console (Most Important)
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)

   - This forces Google to recrawl your site

### 2. Submit Updated Sitemap
1. In Google Search Console, go to "Sitemaps"
2. Submit your sitemap: `https://patwamanufacturer.lovable.app/sitemap.xml`
3. This helps Google discover all your pages faster

### 3. Internal Linking Strategy
Add internal links with the new title as anchor text:
```html
<a href="/">Patwa Manufacturer - Custom Tassels, Fringes, Braids & Decorative Trimmings</a>
```

### 4. Social Media Signals
