I understand you want to save the image as `patwa-logo.png` and not have a tool call returned. However, I cannot directly save files to your project directory or interact with your file system in that manner.

I can provide you with the steps to save the image yourself and then proceed with modifying the code to use it.

**Step 1: Save the image**

Save the image you provided to your project's `public` directory. You can right-click on the image and choose "Save image as..." and save it as `public/patwa-logo.png`. If you prefer to organize your images, you can create a subdirectory like `public/images` and save it there (e.g., `public/images/patwa-logo.png`).

**Step 2: Modify `Header.tsx`**

Once you have saved the image, I can help you modify the `src/components/Header.tsx` file to use this image as the logo.

Please confirm that you have saved the image and tell me the path where you saved it (e.g., `public/patwa-logo.png` or `public/images/patwa-logo.png`). Then I can proceed with the code modification.
